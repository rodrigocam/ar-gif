# ar-gif
Easy to use augmented reality web components!


## Introduction
ar-gif is an effort to bring augmented reality with web components in a easy way. It supports **gif**, **png**, **jpg**, **mp4** and **webm** playing with pattern detection markers, but if you want to add new functionalities feel free to contribute.

This web-component is used in [Jandig](https://github.com/memeLab/Jandig), a project the aims to bring AR and Art for everyone.

### Usage
ar-gif has a simple API, we have an ar-scene and one or more ar-markers.
```html
<ar-scene>
  <ar-marker patt="hiro.patt" content="hiro.gif"></ar-marker>
  <ar-marker patt="cat.patt" content="cat.mp4"></ar-marker>
</ar-scene>
```

You can use also use some simple attributes to control the appeareance.

- scale : as a two dimensional vector
- position : as a three dimensional vector
- rotation : as a three dimensional vector
- audio : [0|1] If your mp4 supports audio. The default behavior is muted playback.
- loop : [0|1] Stop a mp4 video at the end. The default behavior is looped playback.


```html
<ar-scene>
  <ar-marker patt="hiro.patt" content="hiro.gif" scale="1 1" position="0 0 0" rotation="0 0 0"></ar-marker>
  <ar-marker patt="cat.patt" content="cat.mp4" audio="1" loop="0"></ar-marker>
</ar-scene>
```
Each ar-scene is responsible to detect every marker inside it and each marker is reponsible to show his content.
The "patt" attribute indicates which pattern will be registered for that marker and the content is the **gif**, **image** or **video** that will be played.
